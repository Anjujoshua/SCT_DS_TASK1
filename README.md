# SCT_DS_TASK1
As part of my internship, my first task involved creating a bar chart in power BI using the given Dataset to analyze and visualize data distributions effectively. This dataset, containing female and male population, provided an excellent opportunity to practice organizing data into creative dashboards. Utilizing power BI as a powerful data analysis tool,here I crafted a bar chart to present the population of females and males based on age and countries, making it easier to identify population in diffrent countries. This task enhanced my technical proficiency in data visualization and reinforced my ability to communicate insights clearly. Successfully completing this assignment marked a strong start to my internship.
